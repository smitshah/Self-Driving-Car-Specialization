# Road Network Shortest Path Search

**This is an ungraded practice assignment.** In this notebook, you will be given an opportunity to implement Dijkstra's search algorithm on a road network in Berkeley, California. You will then modify that algorithm using a distance heuristic to perform A* search. You will then get a chance to compare your shortest path to the mapping library's path. If they match, congratulations!

**In this notebook, you will:**
* Implement Dijkstra's search algorithm on a road network graph.
* Implement the A* search algorithm using a Euclidean heuristic on a road network graph.

For most exercises, you are provided with a suggested outline. You are encouraged to diverge from the outline if you think there is a better, more efficient way to solve a problem.
