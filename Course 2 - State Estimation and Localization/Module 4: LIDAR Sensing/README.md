**Question No. 2**

A 3D LIDAR unit is scanning a surface that is approximately planar, returning range, elevation and azimuth measurements. In order to estimate the equation of the surface in parametric form (as a plane), we need to find a set of parameters that best fit the measurements.

Implement the *sph_to_cat* and *estimate_params* functions, which transform LIDAR measurements into a Cartesian coordinate frame and estimate the plane parameters, respectively. You may assume that measurement noise is negligible. The code comments provide more information on the format of the arguments to each function.
