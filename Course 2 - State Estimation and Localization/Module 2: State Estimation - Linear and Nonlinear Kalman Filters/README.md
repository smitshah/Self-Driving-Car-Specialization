# Module 2 Graded Notebook: Estimating a Vehicle Trajectory

The final assignment of this module will test what you've learned so far by having you implement your own recursive estimator! You will be implementing an Extended Kalman filter, which will estimate the trajectory of a vehicle using odometry, range and bearing measurements.

To start, simply press the "Open Notebook" button below, this will bring up the workspace file system. Navigate to the *module 2* folder.

The *data* folder contains assignment data such as measurements and landmark locations. Open *assg_learner.ipynb* to access the Jupyter notebook.

When you are done with the assignment, a new file *submission.pkl*, will appear in the workspace. Download the file and submit it in the programming assignment item.


# Programming Assignment: Module 2 Graded Notebook (Submission): Estimating a Vehicle Trajectory

**Instructions**

To submit your assignment, just click on "My Submission" and "Create Submission". Now upload the *submission.pkl* file you've generated in the assignment.

Your final score is based on the percentage of trajectory points that you estimated to lie within a pre-determined error margin (distance from the true trajectory points). A good solution will produce a percentage of 90% or more.
