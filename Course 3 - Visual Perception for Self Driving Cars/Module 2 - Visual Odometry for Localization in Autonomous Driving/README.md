# Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving

Welcome to the assignment for Module 2: Visual Features - Detection, Description and Matching. In this assignment, you will practice using the material you have learned to estimate an autonomous vehicle trajectory by images taken with a monocular camera set up on the vehicle.

**In this assignment, you will:**
* Extract features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.
* Use the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.
* Use the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs.
* Use the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.

For most exercises, you are provided with a suggested outline. You are encouraged to diverge from the outline if you think there is a better, more efficient way to solve a problem.

| **Task** | **Grade** | **Grading Criterion** |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Trajectory Estimation | 100% | A full mark is awarded if the mean square error (MSE) between the output trajectory and the ground truth is less than 0.5. Every 10% MSE decrease subtracts 10% from your grade. The assignment is passed when earn at least 50% is earned. |
